How to set up Postgres database user:
```
-- Step 1: Create database user
CREATE USER atoms_user_ WITH PASSWORD 'your_strong_password';

-- Step 2: Revoke existing privileges from the public role
REVOKE ALL ON SCHEMA public FROM public;

-- Step 3: Grant the new user ownership of the public schema
-- This is a very powerful permission and should be used with care
ALTER SCHEMA public OWNER TO atoms_user;

-- Step 4: Grant all privileges on all existing tables in the public schema to the new user
-- This handles any pre-existing tables, like __EFMigrationsHistory, that might have been created by doadmin
GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON ALL TABLES IN SCHEMA public TO atoms_user;

-- Step 5: Set default privileges for all future tables to be created by the new user
ALTER DEFAULT PRIVILEGES FOR USER atoms_user IN SCHEMA public GRANT ALL ON TABLES TO atoms_user;

-- Step 6: Grant all privileges on the database to the new user
GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON DATABASE "Atoms" TO atoms_user;

-- Step 7: (Optional but recommended) Re-grant CONNECT to the public role for other users
-- This allows other users (if any) to connect without affecting your schema
GRANT CONNECT ON DATABASE "Atoms" TO public;
